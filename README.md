# The Reading World Library
The Reading World Library is engaged in the collection, preservation, and provision of literary works, and also offers a wide range of services to its visitors. Every person whose data is recorded must have either a personal user ID card or a visitor ticket to access the library.

The core of our database consists of the following main entities:

Our employees are registered in the system with a unique employee ID and personal details such as first name, last name, home address, phone number, email, and number of fines. In addition, employees receive a free employee card, which contains all their contact information, allows entry to the library as a staff member, and records check-in and check-out times, purchase history, and book borrowing records. Employees also receive a special discount – the ability to purchase books at 15% less than the regular price.

Employees are responsible for a range of tasks related to books, such as managing loans (a book can be borrowed for up to 2 weeks) and purchases. They are also in charge of the library's book clubs. In addition, employees have the authority to issue fines in case of violations (such as late returns, book theft, or damage), and they are the ones who apply these fines.

Fines depend on the user’s status. Below are the penalties applied to registered users, structured into three levels:

The first level applies to those who for the first time return a book late, steal a book, or damage it. This level includes a payment of 50 euros, a 1-week ban on borrowing books, and a 1-week ban on purchasing books. The second level applies to those who have already received a first-level fine and commit another violation (late return, theft, or damage). This level includes a 150-euro fine, a 24-week ban on borrowing books, and a 24-week ban on purchasing books. The third level applies to those who have already received first- and second-level fines and commit another violation. This level includes a 500-euro fine, a 52-week ban on borrowing and purchasing books, and the removal of the user's club membership card.

The database also registers information about visitors – Citizens. Depending on their status, citizens have different levels of access:

Registered citizens can purchase a library registration for 20 euros, which gives them a registered user card that grants access to the library. This card contains all their contact information, purchase and borrowing history, check-in and check-out times, and the number of fines. Registered citizens have reading access, can borrow books, buy books, and receive an 8% discount as registered users. They can also be fined for late returns or book damage. Additionally, registered users may attend the library’s book clubs, where books are discussed based on specific topics.

Unregistered citizens have access only to reading. They can obtain a one-time visit ticket by providing their first and last name. This ticket includes the number of fines and check-in and check-out times, but does not contain detailed personal data and therefore does not allow borrowing books. Purchasing books is allowed for all users, but if the user is not registered, the purchase is not recorded in the purchase history. Such users may also be fined. For unregistered users, a three-level fine system is applied:

The first level applies to unregistered users who for the first time steal or damage a book. This includes a payment of 70 euros and a 1-week ban on purchasing books. The second level applies to those who have already received a first-level fine and commit another violation (theft or damage). This level includes a payment of 200 euros and a 12-week ban on purchasing books. The third level applies to users who have already received both first- and second-level fines and commit another violation. This includes a payment of 600 euros, a 52-week ban on purchasing books, and blocking of the possibility to obtain a visitor ticket.
